# lego+python=mosaic
 Program was developed to simplify creating mosaic from images using Lego-like bricks.

## The idea
 I was thinking about a birthday gift for my fianc√©e, and I came with this concept - to create a mosaic using our pictures and Lego bricks.

## How does it work ?
 Firstly this program transforms selected image to a palette of certain colors. 
 After that it creates a PDF containing building instructions for this new image.

## How to run it ?
 `Warning!` This program was tested with python 3.7 (I had some issues to build .exe using 3.8 and 3.9).
 
 It's a good idea to create and activate a virtual environment first using e.g. `virtualnenv`.

 Clone this repository to your hard drive with:
 #### `git clone https://github.com/kjuraszek/lego-python-mosaic`

 Install packages in project directory using e.g. `pip` and `requirements.txt` file.
 #### `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

 Run program:
 #### `python3 main.py`

## How to use it ?

First you have to prepare your desired image - its dimensions (in pixels) must be equal to 
the size (in bricks) of mosaic you are planning to create. E.g. when your plate is 50 by 50 
bricks, your image dimensions must be 50px by 50px. 

The next step is to add colors to your palette. Keep in mind that some colors aren't used in brick production - you are limited to less 
than 300 colors. At this stage it is better to keep Don't generate PDF option turned on to test 
selected color palette. The process of creating desired image can take even up to a few minutes - 
it depends on amount of colors in your palette and dimensions of image. 

When you are satisfied with output image you can turn off Don't generate PDF option. This process also can take up to a
few minutes - it depends on amount of colors in your palette and dimensions of image. The PDF 
consists of total bricks amount of each color and building instructions divided in steps - each 
step is one row.

Have fun!
